# Capstone project - Automation

This capstone project is an automated process to complete vendor checks and store the results as openable PDF documents for the DIR contract managers. It is a python-based program that involves web scraping, database query, and auto-creation of documents. Vendor account information is fetched from Salesforce by using the Salesforce REST API client.
